# mass-spring-damper
Simulation of mass-spring-damper system. 

Live demo is avaiable here: https://entangled-thoughts.com/ar/demos/mass-spring-damper/

The easiest way to run locally is follow these instruction ([taken from threejs](https://threejs.org/docs/#manual/en/introduction/Installation)):
1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).
2. Install three.js and a build tool [Vite](https://vite.dev/), using a terminal in this project folder.
```bash
# three.js
npm install --save three

# vite
npm install --save-dev vite
```
3. From your terminal, run:
```bash
npx vite
```
4. If everything went well, you'll see a URL like http://localhost:5173 appear in your terminal, and can use that URL to open the simulation.
